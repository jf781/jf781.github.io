My name is Joe Fecht.  I have been heavily focused on Microsoft server technologies for about the past 15 years.  This included a lot of Windows Server, Exchange, SharePoint, SQL, and a variety of other products in that ecosystem.  I enjoyed the challenges of it all and then, I found PowerShell it really started to get exciting.  

Fast forward to today.  I'm making/made the transition to become more focused on cloud technologies, DevOps, and my mindset about everything.  I'm happy to say it has been an game changer for me as once again, everything is exciting and new.  I'm constantly learning and being challenged and feel more invigorated in my career then I have in the past.  

My goal with writing this blog is to help share what I'm learning.  I'm hopeful that it can help you find the answer to a quick question, or maybe help play a factor and in how you manage your career.  I have had a number of invaluable resources who helped me reach where I am today and am forever grateful to them.  It's time I start to give back.
