One of the main reasons I wanted to start blogging was to help give back to the community that has helped shape my career into what it is today.

I was essentially given free range to work to help shape the environment.  It was a fantastic experience and a great company to work with.  After 8 years I decided to get into more of a consultant role and for the past 6 I've worked at two different MSPs.  The first one was for a regional provider and who focused more in the SMB market.  The second was a national provider whose focused on the mid-market businesses.  My role there was predominately a 



Around 2016 I started to become more interested in this thing called Azure.  Trying to understand what it is and more importantly, the benefits over on-premises infrastructure.  I started to play with it and learn the various ways that I could leverage it, even got certified in it.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to put what I was learning 


Around the same time I started to hear more about this Azure thing and cloud computing.  They were talking about moving various systems to cloud hosting vs. keeping them on-premises.
