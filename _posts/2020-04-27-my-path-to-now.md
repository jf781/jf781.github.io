I worked at some great companies and had some fantastic bosses who really let me push things.  Allowed me to go trainings and conferences, etc.  I got approved for a training course in Phoenix to learn PowerShell with Don Jones and Jason Helmick around 2012 and it really opened my eyes to all the possibilities for automation in the IT world (Insert jokes from the *nix teams).  I started to think of all the processes and procedures I could automate.  Again, I had a great boss who let me go crazy and IT was fun again.  

Around 2016 I started to become more interested in this thing called Azure.  Trying to understand what it is and more importantly, the benefits over on-premises infrastructure.  I started to play with it and learn the various ways that I could leverage it, even got certified in it.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to put what I was learning 


Around the same time I started to hear more about this Azure thing and cloud computing.  They were talking about moving various systems to cloud hosting vs. keeping them on-premises.
